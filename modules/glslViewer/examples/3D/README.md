Here you will find some 3D shaders examples(vertex/fragmente runing on a geometry). Have in mind that GlslViewer provide:

* a default vertex shader so most of the time you don't need to define a vertex shader. You can retrive this default vertex shader with the command:

`vert,<filename.vert>`

* a defailt fragment shader with a standard PBR model. So if you want you can just load the model with GlslViewer and the get the default frament shader using the command:

`frag,<filename.frag>`

This way you can quickly start editing a shader not from scratch.
