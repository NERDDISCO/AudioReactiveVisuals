# Part 1: The High Priestessssss

This episode was recorded while I was visiting my friend Gregor in Hamburg. I was not prepared for the episode (I knew what I wanted to work on, "The High Priestess", but did not think about how I will use it) and I also didn't think about how the recording will work in Gregor's flat. So in the end Gregor was on the phone for the whole episode (as 9 pm CEST he is talking with a friend every Sunday = same time as the stream) which was very distracting. That in combination with me not being prepared enough, resulted in this episode. I'm not very happy with the result, that's why I recorded part 2 a week later, see https://youtu.be/_tGAd_Vl-4w

I called this "The High Priestessssss" with 6 x s at the end as this represents the tail that was created during this episode.

# Part 2: The High Priestess Society

[![Render of "The High Priestess Society"](The_High_Priestess_Society.jpg)](https://youtu.be/CnLcKWEswRQ)

As part 1 (https://youtu.be/DxYv8NEP9fg) was horrible from my point of view, I started from scatch and tried to explore how the underlying functions to create "The High Priestess" from Pixel Spirit actually work before using them. Then step by step I tried to build what I had in my head: Having 5 circles... top left, top right, center, bottom left, bottom right. The most awesome end-result was made by using glsl "mix" as proposed by ilithya and Lea Rosema (thank you very much). 

I called this "The High Priestess Society" as the 5 unique circles combined with each other form different kind of shapes over time, like a secret society would to stay hidden.
