# Audio Reactive Visuals: Season 1

In this season we are coding our way through all cards from [Pixel Spirit](https://patriciogonzalezvivo.github.io/PixelSpiritDeck/). Each card contains the glsl code to create a basic shader element and we want to turn these elements into audio reactive visuals. With each episode, we learn more basics about working with shaders and which techiques exist to combine them with audio.
